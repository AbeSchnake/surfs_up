## Results
* The observed temperatures do not vary much between December anf June, making Hawaii the ideal location for a surf shop. There is only a 3.9 degree difference in the mean temperatures.
* The minimum temperature in December is 56 degrees, compared to a minimum temperature of 64 degrees in June. While a difference of 8 degrees does not seem like a lot, but 56 degrees is too cold for most people to swim, whereas 64 degrees is warm enough that adventerous swimmers might brave the waters. While the surf shop will be able to remain open year-round, it should be expected that the absolute coldest days of the year will be too cold for beachgoers to want to hit the beaches.
* The maximum temperature for June is 85 degrees, which is very close to the maximum temperature for December, 83 degrees. This is a very comfortable temperature for swimmers, and the surf shop should not expect to ever have a day where it is too hot for swimmers to attend the beach.
## Summary
In summary, the temperatures observed are just about ideal for opening a surf shop. If W. Avy has any remaining concerns about the weather, queries could be run on precipitation during different seasons or precipitation at different temperatures to ensure that the most valuable times of year or the most ideal temperature conditions won't be rained out.
